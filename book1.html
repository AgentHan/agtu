        <h3>【Author introduction】</h3>
<p>Megyn Kelly currently serves as anchor of Fox News Channels The Kelly File. Throughout her tenure with Fox News Channel, Kelly has covered breaking news and reported on location. Before joining Fox News, Kelly served as a general assignment reporter for WJLA-TV (ABC 7) in Washington, D.C., where she covered national and local stories of interest. Prior to her career in television news, Kelly practiced law for nine years, seven years as a corporate litigator at Jones Day and was an associate for two years in the Chicago office of the law firm Bickel & Brewer LLP. She lives in New York with her husband and children.</p>
	<p>Whether it’s asking tough questions during a presidential debate or pressing for answers to today’s most important issues, Megyn Kelly has demonstrated the intelligence, strength, common sense, and courage that have made her one of today’s best-known journalists, respected by women and men, young and old, Republicans and Democrats.

In Settle for More, the anchor of The Kelly File reflects on the enduring values and experiences that have shaped her—from growing up in a family that rejected the "trophies for everyone" mentality, to her father’s sudden, tragic death while she was in high school. She goes behind-the-scenes of her career, sharing the stories and struggles that landed her in the anchor chair of cable’s #1 news show. Speaking candidly about her decision to "settle for more"—a motto she credits as having dramatically transformed her life at home. She lives in New York with her husband and children.

    <h4>Ashley Hall</h4> 
		<P>I'm a little more than halfway through the book, and it's a struggle. For someone who's had an extremely fabulous, interesting life, she certainly has a most tedious way of presenting it. Granted, her early life was just ordinary, I would have enjoyed reading about my neighbor's childhood as lackluster as Ms. Kelly has presented hers, but she or her editor could surely have presented it in a way that the reader wouldn't have wanted to give up halfway through. Maybe she should have left the early part out since she didn't present it in a way interesting to the reader, or she's just not that interesting of a person. Now let's see if I can get through the second part if the book.</P>

		<P>This book was very mediocre, in my opinion. I had a hard time staying with it; I really wanted to lay it down many times. There was nothing extraordinary about it. When I got to the chapter about the election, it took off! Then I couldn't put it down! Was it Megyn or Donald Trump? It lit a fire in me, but sadly, it was extinguished quickly! I enjoyed the behind the scenes look into their lives. Would I recommend this book to others? Perhaps. Was it the best book I've ever read? Far from it! Will I still watch The Kelly File every night? Absolutely!</P>
